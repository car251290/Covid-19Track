# Using material-ui for the design of the card

Why use Material-UI's styling solution?

In previous versions, Material-UI has used LESS, then a custom inline-style solution to write the component styles, but these approaches have proven to be limited. A CSS-in-JS solution overcomes many of those limitations, and unlocks many great features (theme nesting, dynamic styles, self-support, etc.).

Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint and remember that cards are entry points to more complex and detailed information.

This demo lets you preview the card component, its variations, and configuration options. Each tab displays a different type of card.
