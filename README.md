# Using material-ui for the design of the card

Why use Material-UI's styling solution?

In previous versions, Material-UI has used LESS, then a custom inline-style solution to write the component styles, but these approaches have proven to be limited. A CSS-in-JS solution overcomes many of those limitations, and unlocks many great features (theme nesting, dynamic styles, self-support, etc.).
